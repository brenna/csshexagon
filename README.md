A pure CSS hexagon generator web app built in AngularJS.

The beautiful love child of [this CodePen](http://codepen.io/brenna/pen/hbDqL) and wanting to learn Angular.

## THE FUTURE

If you're looking to make a code hexagon in the year 2017 or beyond, I'd now recommend you try out SVG. You'll have a lot more flexibility to customize your hexagon shape, and you can still do fun things like [image fills](http://codepen.io/brenna/pen/JdCba). 

I'm leaving this project up for fun and education, but it will no longer be actively maintained.
